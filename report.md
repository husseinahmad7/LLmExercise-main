# Fine-tuning:

## Pros:
Customizes the model for specific tasks.
Can achieve high accuracy for specific datasets.
## Cons:
Requires substantial computational resources.
Time-consuming and needs labeled data.

## Use Case: When a highly specialized model for a specific task is needed.

# RAG Architecture:

## Pros:
No need for extensive fine-tuning.
Can handle diverse and dynamic information.
Combines retrieval and generation, improving context relevance.
## Cons:
Dependent on the quality of the retriever and database.
Might not be as specialized as a fine-tuned model.

## Use Case: When dealing with large, diverse, and frequently updated information sources.
